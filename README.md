### Task 2 - Weather Application  
Things to note in this project:
1. I used data captured at 17 July 2024, 21.00 WIB at Mucca Authentic Cafe
2. Data captured is transformed into JSON and stored in assets folder
3. I was considering a more proper application with clean architecture, location services, and more modular application in general.
4. I am grateful for this opportunity and I hope for the best. For me and also for CAD-IT Global.
